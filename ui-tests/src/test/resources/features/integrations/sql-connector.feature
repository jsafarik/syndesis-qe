Feature: SQL Connector

  Background: Clean application state
    Given clean application state
    And log into the Syndesis
    And truncate "todo" table
    And navigate to the "Home" page

  #
  # 1. Check that SQL connector pulls all rows on exchange when SQL connector is as middle step
  # (having SQL connector as 'from' or 'to' doesn't cause issue from GH-3856)
